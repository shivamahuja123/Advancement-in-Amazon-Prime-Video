We have been reading the genre for fiction books then why not for movies too. So with this let us get reviewed regarding the latest movie hitting the screen in the city as well as know the genre and recommendation with the next movie ticket you can purchase to bing on. Cheers with coke and chocolates.

This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, etc.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4` and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.
